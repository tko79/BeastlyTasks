# function __calc_column_width
#          Calculate the column width. Depending on 1- and 2-byte characters
#          (umlauts, ...) the actual width of a column differs from the number
#          of characters (e.g. test√∂: 5 characters with 6 byte).
# param    $1: column content
#          $2: expected column width
# return   column width in characters
